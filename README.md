Project Title: In-Memory Database System
Running the Code
Prerequisites: Make sure you have gcc installed for compilation of a cpp program.
Compilation
A Makefile is provided to simplify the compilation process. To compile the program, open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the code and run the following command: "make"

Execution
After compiling the code, you can run the program by typing: "./program"

Follow the prompts to interact with the in-memory database system.

Suggestions for Future Assignments
To enhance this assignment for future educational purposes, consider the following improvements:

Error Handling: Include more detailed examples and requirements on error handling within the transactional operations to help students understand robust software design.
Extended Functionality: Encourage the implementation of additional features such as handling different data types or supporting concurrent transactions to deepen the learning experience.
Automated Testing: Provide a framework or guidelines for students to write unit tests for their code. This could involve using simple test frameworks available in C++ to ensure functionality works as expected.
Grading Rubric: Develop a more detailed grading rubric that includes points for code style, documentation, and performance considerations. This will help students focus not just on functionality but also on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.
By implementing these suggestions, the assignment will not only be clearer and more structured but also more comprehensive, teaching students additional skills that are vital in software development.
